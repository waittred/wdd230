    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>This website will attract individuals who love the outdoors, like to stay fit through fun activities, enjoy seeing rare 
        glimpses of wildlife and vegitation, provide fun outings for individuals or families, enjoy adrenaline, and the pure enjoyment
        of being on the water. We need to keep in mind of individuals who prefer to get all their information online instead of calling our business. 
        In other words, we need to spell out clearly who we are both in words and in pictures. Our content, colors, fonts, etc. will help to create 
        excitement, wonder, and hone in their curiosity so they will want to experience for themselves this fun and exciting activity. Additonally, we need to
        remember our audience who likes to access websites on desktop/laptop, tablets, and mobile devices.    </p>
