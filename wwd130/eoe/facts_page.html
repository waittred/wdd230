      <h2>Symptoms</h2>
        
        <p>Symptoms among individuals vary based on several factors, such as age, developmental ability, and communication factors.</p>
        
        <p>The most common symptoms among individuals are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Acid reflux (infant, child, adult)</li>
                <li>Difficulty swallowing (child, adult)</li>
                <li>Food impaction in the esophagus (older children/teens, adults)</li>
                <li>Nausea/Vomiting (all ages)</li>
                <li>Failure to thrive- due to poor appetite/pain swallowing (infant, child, rarely adult)</li>
                <li>Abdominal pain/chest pain (child, adult)</li>
                <li>Feeding refusal/intolerance/poor diet (infant, child)</li>
                <li>Sleeping issues (infant, child, adult)</li>

        <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
        
        <p>For a patient to be correctly diagnosed with EOE, a patient must be put on an acid suppressor for at least six weeks to rule out GERD. 
        After six weeks, a doctor will perform an endoscopy. An endoscopy involves:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Placing a patient under general anesthesia.</li> 
              <li>Inserting a small tube (endoscope) through the mouth.</li>
              <li>Insert the tube down into the stomach and the first part of the small intestine.</li>
        </ul>
       <p>During the endoscopy, the doctor will take several biopsies from several different locations throughout the esophagus and upper
       gastrointestinal (GI) area. After the endoscopy is completed, the doctor will send the biopsies of tissue samples taken during the
       procedure to a pathologist. The requirement of taking biopsies is crucial. During the initial inspection of the esophagus and upper
       GI, everything may look ok; however, tissue damage and inflammation may be present in deeper tissue layers that are unseen to the eye. 
       A positive EOE diagnosis involves a count greater than 15 eosinophils seen under a high-powered microscope. Unfortunately, there are no
       non-invasive tests to diagnose EoE besides endoscopies.</p>

        <h2>Treatment</h2>

        <p>There are two main treatment methods to manage EOE. These methods include elimination diets and medications. For some patients, a combination of diet and medications is necessary.
         Elimination diets can vary depending on a patient’s symptoms of suspected or known EoE triggers. Some patients may need to go on an elimination (removal of food in a person’s diet) 
         of the top eight common food allergens: milk, wheat, egg, soy, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish. Sometimes, a short-term temporary placement of a nasogastric (nasal) tube or 
         a more long-term placement G-tube (a tube inserted through the belly and directly to the stomach) is required for proper nourishment.</p>
         
       <p>Medications like topical steroids, acid suppressors, or a combination are required to manage an individual's response to EoE. Topical steroids, like fluticasone or budesonide, 
         are commonly used for the treatment of asthma, are used. Instead of inhaling the topical steroids, patients will puff the medication into their mouths, swish it around 
         with their spit, and then swallow. Additionally, a patient may have to mix liquid budesonide (commonly called a “slurry”) with Splenda, apple sauce, or chocolate syrup in order to make 
         it palatable to swallow and adhere to the esophagus as it is swallowed.</p>
         
       <p>Until recently, there was no FDA-approved medication for the treatment of EOE. However, a new medication called Dupixent© sent shock waves through the EoE community when in May 2022 it was approved 
          for the treatment of EoE. Dupixent is known to target an underlying source of inflammation, which is known to be a cause of EoE.</p>
